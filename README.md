## Tell us what your idea is
HAMT stands for "Health & Medication Tracker". This app helps you to keep a track of all your medication needs on the go. 
As a caring childeren i am always worried about whether my parents are taking their medication on time or not, and most of us these days are living away from their parents for work so its not always possible for us to check on them personally. So how about a portable device (pillbox) which tracks the medication based on the prescription prescribed by the doctor.

The app will use ML models to scan the medical prescription using phone camera and then extract out all the necessary information in order to develop a daily schedule for the patient, later the app will push the generated medication schedule to the device (pillbox) and the device will remind the patient to take the medicine on time and also inform the connected family members in case if patient forgot to take medicine or taking any wrong dosage. 

Later on using ML models app will predict the type of disease based on the medicines patient is taking and also there will be a provision to analyze heartrate using in app ML-model, logging Blood pressure etc and generate report which can be sent to the concerned doctor for further analysis.


## Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life
We are working on developing ML models for extracting useful information from prescriptions & paharmacy bills.Trying to gather as much prescriptions and medical bills as possible for training models. App UI/UX developement has been started its in initial phase right now. 

Our timeline for the project is :

- **December 2019 - January 2020** : Complete working on the models that identify prescriptions and pharmacy bills and convert them into useful information.
- **January - February 2020** : Work on the APIs and hardware part of the device. Planning to develop one pillbox prototype device using raspberry Pi 3.
-> Integrating all the necessary sensors for detecting pill count, pill usage etc.
- **March - April 2020** : Finish work on the UI/UX part of the app and integrate it with the trained ML models.
- **May 2020** : Setting up of servers and databases. Final integration of pillbox and android app via cloud infrastructure.

## Tell us about you
I am a enthusiastic Android developer working from last 4years. I always keep looking for the new opportunities that can be solved using the power of Machine learning & Artificial Intelligence. 

I have completed android developer certification in 2018. I started my machine learning journey from as a student by persuing the "Machine learning foundation" course from udacity. After that i have built a few ML models for learning purposes, also i have hand on expirience with computer vision and openCV for doing image processing.

I have also attended Google Cloud Dev Summit 2019, and till now developed over 20 quality apps which are hosted on play store.
